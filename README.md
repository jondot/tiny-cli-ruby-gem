# tiny-cli-ruby-gem

A simple rubygem for making a CLI.
Based on a lightweight `slop` that has testing and fixtures built in.

## Quickstart

We'll make a new CLI named `fable` with main module name named `Fable`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jondot/tiny-cli-ruby-gem
$ cd tiny-cli-ruby-gem
$ rake provision[Fable,fable]
$ cd ..
$ mv tiny-cli-ruby-gem fable
```
Done.
